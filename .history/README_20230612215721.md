# MOSCAL-2.0

This program is a dynamics solver for open quantum systems, mainly based on the dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) formalism. The code is written in C++ and uses Python being the input script generator.

# Dissipaton equation of motion

Dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) is an exact formalism for open quantum systems with Gaussian environment ans√§tz. It is a second quantization generalization of the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), a derivative equivalence of the well known Feynman--Vernon

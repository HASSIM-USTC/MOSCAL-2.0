# MOSCAL-2.0

This program is a dynamics solver for open quantum systems, mainly based on the dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) formalism. The code is written in C++ and uses Python being the input script generator.

# Dissipaton equation of motion

Dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) is an exact approach for open quantum systems with Gaussian environment ansÃ¤tz. It is a second quantization generalization of the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), a derivative equivalence of the well known Feynman-Vernon influence functional formalism. 

For the bosonic bath case, the Hamiltonian takes the total system-plus-bath composite form, 
$$
H_{\rm T} = H_{\rm S} + h_{\rm B} + \sum_{u}\hat Q_u\hat F_u,
$$
where the system Hamiltonian $H_{\rm S}$ and interacting mode $\hat Q_u$ can be arbitrary operators, and the bath satisfies
$$
h_{\rm B} = \sum_{j}\frac{\omega_{j}}{2}(\hat p_j^2+\hat x_j^2)
$$
and 
$$
\hat F_u = \sum_{j}c_{uj}\hat x_j.
$$
To obtain the exact dynamics of open systems, we introduce the dynamic variables in DEOM, the dissipaton density operators (DDOs), 
$$
\rho_{\bf n}^{(n)}(t) \equiv {\rm tr}_{\rm B}\left[ \left( \prod_{uk}\hat f_{uk}^{n_{uk}} \right)^\circ\rho_{\rm T}(t) \right],
$$
with ${\bf n} \equiv \{ n_{uk}=0,1,2,\cdots \}$, $n\equiv \sum_{uk}n_{uk}$, $\hat f_{uk}$ being the dissipaton operators, and $\rho_{\rm T}$ the total density operator. Note here $\rho^{(0)}(t)$ is the reduced system density operator.

Then one can map the total space dynamics, 
$$
\dot\rho_{\rm T}(t) = -i[H_{\rm T},\rho_{\rm T}(t)],
$$
into the DEOM space, with initial state 
$$
\rho_{\rm T}(0) = \rho_{\rm S}(0)\otimes \frac{e^{-\beta h_{\rm B}} }{Z_{\rm B}} \ \ \Longrightarrow \{ \rho^{(0)}(0) = \rho_{\rm S}(0), \rho^{(n>0)}(0) = 0 \}.
$$

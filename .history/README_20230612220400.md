# MOSCAL-2.0

This program is a dynamics solver for open quantum systems, mainly based on the dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) formalism. The code is written in C++ and uses Python being the input script generator.

# Dissipaton equation of motion

Dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) is an exact approach for open quantum systems with Gaussian environment ans√§tz. It is a second quantization generalization of the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), a derivative equivalence of the well known Feynman-Vernon influence functional formalism. 

For the bosonic bath case, the Hamiltonian takes the total system-plus-bath composite form, 
$$
H_{\rm T} = H_{\rm S} + h_{\rm B} + \sum_{u}\hat Q_u\hat F_u,
$$
where 
$$
h_{\rm B} = \sum_{j}\frac{\omega_{j}}{2}
$$
